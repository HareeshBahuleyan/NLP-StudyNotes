Word Sense Disambiguation
- understand which sense of a word was intended in a given context. Example: serve can be [help with food or drink] or [old an office] or [put ball into play]

Pronoun Resolution
- whom does the pronoun refer to?
	Example:
	a. The thieves stole the paintings. They were subsequently sold.
	b. The thieves stole the paintings. They were subsequently caught.
	c. The thieves stole the paintings. They were subsequently found.
Computational techniques for tackling this problem include anaphora resolution—identifying what a pronoun or noun phrase refers to—and semantic role labeling—identifying how a noun phrase relates to the verb (as agent,
patient, instrument, and so on).
